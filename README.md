# Project Repository

## Overview
This repository contains multiple Python scripts covering arithmetic operations, BMI calculation, electricity bill computation, gym management, and more. Additionally, it includes text and document files for reference.

## File Descriptions

### Python Scripts:
1. **arithematic.py** - Implements basic arithmetic operations.
2. **bmi.py** - Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input.
3. **code.py** - Contains general-purpose Python code.
4. **cons.py** - Likely related to constants or data processing.
5. **electricitybill.py** - Computes electricity bill based on usage.
6. **gym.py** - Manages gym-related functionalities (e.g., workout tracking).
7. **hello.py** - Basic introductory script (e.g., prints a greeting).
8. **invited_name.txt** - Stores names of invited individuals.
9. **leap.py** - Checks whether a given year is a leap year.
10. **main.py** - Main script for running project-related functionalities.
11. **my_module.py** - Custom Python module for reusable functions.
12. **pizaa.py** - Likely handles pizza order calculations.
13. **randmodule.py** - Demonstrates Pythonâ€™s random module usage.
14. **roller.py** - Could be a dice roller or number generator.
15. **str.py** - Works with string manipulations.
16. **tax.py** - Computes tax-related calculations.

### Text and Document Files:
1. **harsh.txt** - A text file, possibly containing logs or user data.
2. **letter_for_harsh kulkarni.docx** - A document addressed to Harsh Kulkarni.
3. **starting_letter.docx** - Another document, likely a template or predefined letter.

## Usage
- Run individual scripts using `python filename.py`.
- Ensure Python is installed to execute the scripts properly.
- Modify text files as needed to suit project requirements.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve documentation for each script.
- Integrate related scripts into a single structured project.
- Add error handling and user-friendly prompts to scripts.
